# Container
containers are the most basic layout component in Bootstrap
- They wrap and contain our content
- Provide basic padding and margin to our content
- Help us center our content on the page
- Can be fluid or fixed
- Containers __surround__ the __whole section of rows and column__

# Grid
- Bootstrap comes with a 12-column grid system
- We add our content into the "row" and "column" of this grid using Bootstrap's CSS classes
- Bootstrap will take care of the responsive work for us

# Row & Column
- Rows represent a horizontal line of elements
- Columns represent the horizontal space that elements take up in a row
